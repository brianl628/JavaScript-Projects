<h3>TicTacToe Game</h3>
<p>This is one of my first projects that included CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It is a fully functional TicTacToe game where the player is set up against the computer.</p>

<h3>Pizza Ordering Website</h3>
<p>This is a pizza website where you customize your own pizza with the total being shown as options are being clicked. This was done through CSS, HTML, and Javascript.</p>

<h3>Movie Ticket Sales Website</h3>
<p>This was utilizing bootstrap, and the website details how a movie website would operate. It contains a showing section, along with pictures of the movies and a background on the cinema.</p>
